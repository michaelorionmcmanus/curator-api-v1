## Getting Started

### Virtual Environment
Many of the tools assume that this project is developed under a virtual environment. The general environment dependencies can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.xtx`

### App depdendencies
Application dependencies are installed by running `fab install_vendor_deps`. The requirements file for the `app/vendor` is generated by running `fab pip_freeze_vendor`. This writes the `vendor-requirements.txt` file.

### Running functions locally
This setup assumes a development environment of VSCode. To generate the launch config, run `fab generate_vscode_launch_file`. After this target runs, you can selectively debug each function by selecting it from the debug menu. As additional functions are added re-run the command (it can also be run directly from VSCode)

### Tests
Run tests via `fab test`
